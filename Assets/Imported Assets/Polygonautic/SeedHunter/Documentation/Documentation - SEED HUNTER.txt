NOTE: 
Problems are usually caused by Unity version / package incompatibility, or not using HDRP at all!
This package is not compatible with Built-in renderer, nor LWRP/URP.


2. Assets Organization

All graphical assets are located in respective Art folders, further categorized into logical sub-folders for easier navigation.
Each asset shares same unique name across prefab, model, textures, material and Painter project.
We are using these prefixes for quicker search:

env_ (environmental assets, split into Hallway and Chamber categories)
prop_ (detailed prop assets, split into several categories)
coll_ (lowpoly collision models)
tile_ (seamless textures and materials that are not dependant on unique models UVs)
decal_ (textures and materials used for Decal Projectors)
cookie_ (textures used for Light Cookies)
pattern_ (utility textures for various effects and masks)
vfx_ (Visual Effect Graphs and corresponding textures)
emissive_ (common emissive materials that are not dependant on unique models UVs)
timeline_ (Timeline assets)
DetailMap_ (textures with specific channels to be used as Detail Maps only in Lit shader - materials are only for showcase purposes)


3. Demo Scenes

Two scenes are included: AssetShowcase and SeedHunter.
AssetShowcase is filled with all the prefabs that were used in building the SeedHunter scene. You can explore each module / asset on it's own.
SeedHunter is a complex real-time scene with lighting, effects, post-processes and animated sequence, showcasing what is possible to build from the provided assets.


4. Shader Graphs

Included is a simple vertex animation (wind) Grass shader created in Shader Graph, as well as a classic Lit Grass material.
Shader Graph is part of the HDRP in Unity 2019, no need to install the package separately.


5. Visual Effect Graphs

There are 5 simple particle effects created in Visual Effect Graph.
Shader Graph is part of the HDRP in Unity 2019, no need to install the package separately.

NOTE: Included are 3 textures taken from the Unity Particle Pack, which is available for free on the Asset Store.


6. Timeline

Complete cinematic sequence from the promotional video is included, all you need to do is enable the "TIMELINE" folder in the SeedHunter scene.
In order for sequence to work, you need to have a Cinemachine (2.3.4 or above) and Timeline (1.1.0 or above) packages installed.

NOTE: Sequence is without any sounds, as we don't own rights to include those assets.


We spent lot of our free time building this package, which we are giving to the Unity community for free.
If you like the SEED HUNTER and you are planning to use the assets in your own projects, please give us a credit and don't hesitate to share the result with us!
We will be more than happy if you share the SEED HUNTER around the net and leave us a review on the Asset Store.
